# What is Symmetrix?

Symmetrix *abreviated SYMTRX* is an open-source library that provides
specific algorithms and benchmark for exotic matrices.

All matrices are assumed to be dense. Symmetrix do not aim at challenging large projects like BLAS/LAPACK, MKL or Eigen.

# Current features

* Vectors -

* Square matrices -

* Centrosymmetric matrices -

* Bisymmetric matrices -
